## FAQ Snippets (for Rich Results)

**Q: What is a multi-agent AI orchestration framework?**
A: A multi-agent AI orchestration framework coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to work together on complex tasks, with each agent having a focused domain expertise. This framework coordinates 14 agents across software development lifecycle phases.

**Q: How does self-annealing error correction work?**
A: The self-annealing protocol requires every agent to validate inputs before starting, execute their work, verify outputs against acceptance criteria, and correct any errors before handoff. This prevents error propagation across the agent team.

**Q: Is this framework suitable for federal and DoD projects?**
A: Yes, the framework includes built-in AI governance lifecycle management, ISO 42001 alignment, NIST AI RMF compliance support, CPMAI phase enforcement, and audit-ready evidence chains specifically designed for federal contracting requirements.

**Q: What AI platforms does this work with?**
A: The framework is built for Claude Code (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5) and Google Anti-Gravity (Gemini), with extensibility for other platforms.

**Q: How many agents can work in parallel?**
A: The framework supports parallel execution of up to 6-8 agents simultaneously across different workstreams (e.g., Architecture, UI/UX, and Database design can run in parallel).
