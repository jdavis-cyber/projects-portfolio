# AI PM Builder's Template

**Enterprise AI Governance & Lifecycle Management Framework**

**Author**: Jerome Davis — Executive Architect | AI Governance & Strategy

---

A governance-first, multi-agent development framework for building AI applications using agentic coding platforms (Claude Code, Google Antigravity). This repo serves as both the **reusable template** and a **portfolio of projects** built with it.

## What This Is

A complete consulting-grade toolkit for AI project governance and execution, including:

- **14 Specialized AI Agents** — From Requirements BA through Program Analyst, each with defined roles, self-correction protocols, documentation responsibilities, and Director interview procedures
- **22 Governance Templates** — Audit-ready artifacts covering CPMAI v7 lifecycle, CSRMC modernization, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF
- **5 Mandatory Directives** — AI governance framework, self-annealing protocol, human reporting protocol, Director interview protocol, and branding guide
- **Self-Annealing Quality System** — 4-phase error detection and correction loop (Validate → Execute → Verify → Correct)
- **Algorithmic Authority Brand System** — Full Cyber-Secure Futurism design guide with hex values, typography, component specs, and AI prompt templates

## Quick Start

### Start a New Project
```bash
./new-project.sh my-project-name
```
This scaffolds a complete project instance under `projects/my-project-name/` with execution, governance, memory, and orchestration directories — without touching the template layer.

### Launch an Agent Session
```bash
# Claude Code
claude
> "Read CLAUDE.md and .agent/souls/scrum-master.md, then take on the Scrum Master role."

# Google Anti-Gravity
> "Read GEMINI.md and .agent/souls/scrum-master.md, then take on the Scrum Master role."
```
