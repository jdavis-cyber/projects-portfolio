# J. Davis — AI Application Portfolio

**Executive Architect | AI Governance & Strategy**

This repository is the **AI PM Builder's Template** — an enterprise-grade, governance-first framework for building AI applications using multi-agent agentic coding platforms (Claude Code, Google Anti-Gravity).

Every project below was built using this framework's 14-agent fleet, CPMAI lifecycle governance, and self-annealing quality protocols.

---

## The Framework

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **14 Specialized AI Agents** | Requirements BA through Program Analyst — each with defined roles, quality standards, and self-correction protocols |
| **CPMAI v7 Lifecycle** | 6-phase governance with hard phase gates and evidence generation |
| **CSRMC Modernization** | 8 DoD-aligned security and resilience elements |
| **ISO 42001 / NIST AI RMF** | Full standards crosswalk with 22 governance templates |
| **Self-Annealing Protocol** | Mandatory 4-phase error detection and correction loop |
| **Algorithmic Authority Brand** | Cyber-Secure Futurism design system for consistent UI/UX |

For framework details, see the [Quick Start Guide](QUICK-START-GUIDE.md) or [Template Index](directives/templates/TEMPLATE-INDEX.md).

*Projects are listed in reverse chronological order. Each project folder contains its own `PROJECT.md` with full details, demo links, and governance artifacts.*

## How Projects Are Built

Each project in this portfolio follows the same lifecycle:

1. **Phase I — Business Understanding**: Requirements elicitation, mission risk profiling, governance scope definition
2. **Phase II — Data Understanding**: Data inventory, telemetry configuration, bias assessment
3. **Phase III — Data Preparation**: Data lineage, evidence packaging, pipeline validation
4. **Phase IV — Model Development**: Architecture decisions, threat modeling, secure development
5. **Phase V — Model Evaluation**: Independent evaluation, CCV, go/no-go recommendation
6. **Phase VI — Operationalization**: Deployment, monitoring, incident response readiness

Every phase produces traceable governance artifacts. Every agent self-reviews before handoff.
